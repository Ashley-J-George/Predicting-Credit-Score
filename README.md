# Predicting-Loan-Default
In this data science project, we will predict borrowers chance of defaulting on loans by building a default prediction model.

**Default (Banking Terminology):** The borrower unable to repay the loan

## **Techniques Used**
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Artifical Neural Networks

> **Out of the five techniques used in this project, it is found that Artifical Neural Networks gives the highest precision of 82%.**
